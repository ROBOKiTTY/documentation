# Overview

This is a guide for Revolt.js, the official JavaScript API wrapper for Revolt. This guide assumes you have at least a basic knowledge of JavaScript - if you don't, the Discord.JS guide has [several helpful links](https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin) to get you started with the language itself.

You can find its GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/revoltchat/revolt.js) and its NPM listing [here](https://npmjs.com/package/revolt.js).
